    <h1>My Projects</h1>
     <p>
      I have multiple projects that meant a lot to me that I have done this year and in my freshman year of highschool.</p>
    <h2>My I-Search</h2>

   <p>
      One project I did was a 21 page write up on the mental pressures of basketball at a higher level for my freshman english class.</p>
      <p>I also did a presentation on the cons of nuclear power being used around the world, I think it should be used but I volunteered to do why it shouldn't be and it opened my eyes to a lot of new ideas.

<h2>My Trip To Tijuana</h2>
<img class ="Mex" src = "Images/Mexico.jpg">
<p> I am not a member of the community church in Piedmont but every year they host a trip to Tijuana, Mexico</p>
<p> The trip goes to Tijuana and builds homes for people in need. This year there were 12 groups, each group builds a home in 4 days so there were 12 homes made</p>
<p> This trip made me very grateful for what I have and where I live and I am very glad I went</p>
